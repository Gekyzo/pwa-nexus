# Layout and navigation

Rules of `src/sections.js`, `src/modules.js`, `src/onboarding.js` and the views `nav`, `dust` and
`onboarding` of `src/ui/`.

## Size classes

The size classes, the navigation element, the `pane` layout and the safe areas are the rules
LAY-1 to LAY-4 of the design system (04-design-system). In this app the Projects section uses the
`pane` layout (LAY-3). From 840px, with no project open, the detail says `projects.pick`.

## Navigation

- **NAV-1** The sections are `projects` and `settings`, in the order of `SECTIONS`. The navigation
  shows one item for each section that is on (MOD-1): its icon and its name under it, as in
  pwa-shopping-list. The current one has `aria-current="page"`, and its title is the title of the
  header.
- **NAV-2** A horizontal slide of at least 60 px that starts in the header or the content, out of
  a row and of a field, goes to the next section (slide left) or the previous one (slide right).
  It stops at the first and the last section. The content comes in from its side.
- **NAV-3** A press of the item of the section in view closes the detail that is open in it, as
  its back button does: in Projects, an open roadmap goes back to the project list, with no
  search. With no detail open, the press does nothing. `pressSection` of `src/sections.js`.

## Modules

- **MOD-1** `MODULES` lists the parts that Settings turns off: `projects`, which shows the Projects
  section. With a module off, its sections leave the navigation, and a view of one of them goes
  to the first section that is on.
- **MOD-2** The modules that are off are a preference of the device under `pwa-nexus.modules`,
  not part of the doc. No module off removes the key.
- **MOD-3** A switch of Modules animates the item of its section: it breaks into dust and its
  place closes, or its place opens and the dust settles (`src/ui/dust.js`). With reduced motion
  the item goes or comes at once.

## Walkthrough

- **ONB-1** The walkthrough shows at the start of a new install only: no `pwa-nexus.onboarded`
  flag and no stored doc. A storage that cannot be read counts as seen.
- **ONB-2** It has the pages of `PAGES`, each with a drawing, a title and a text. **Next** goes
  forward, **Skip** and Escape close it, a slide or the arrow keys turn a page. The last page has
  **Start** in place of **Next**, and no **Skip**.
- **ONB-3** A close stores the flag. **Show the introduction** in Settings opens it again.
