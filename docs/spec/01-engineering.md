## Code rules

- **ENG-1** A state operation is a pure function `(state, …) → { state }`. It never changes its
  input.
- **ENG-2** A rejected operation returns `{ state, error }` with the same state object. Nothing
  throws for a user error. `error` is a message `{ key, params }`.
- **ENG-3** The screen applies an operation, saves, then builds the page again from the state.
- **ENG-4** A module with a side effect takes the object of that effect as a parameter (the
  storage object), so that a test passes a fake.
- **ENG-5** No module imports `src/app.js`. A view of `src/ui/` renders the screen through
  `render` of `src/ui/context.js`.
- **ENG-6** A module of `src/` is imported by its alias, `from '#notes'`, never by a relative
  path. Node resolves `#name` through `imports` of `package.json`; the browser resolves it through
  the import map of `index.html`. `tests/aliases.test.js` checks that the two agree.
- **ENG-7** A new id comes from `crypto.randomUUID()`. An operation that creates a record takes
  the id as an optional parameter, for the tests.
- **ENG-8** Every storage key is `<slug>.<name>`, from `keyOf` of `src/storage.js` or `APP_SLUG`
  of `src/config.js`, so two apps of one origin do not share data.
- **ENG-16** The screen code is `src/app.js` and the views of `src/ui/`. A view never imports
  `src/app.js`, a pure module never imports a view, and the imports among the views have no
  cycle. `src/ui/context.js` owns the values that the views share; another module reads them
  through its import and changes them only through a setter. `tests/layers.test.js` checks this.
- **ENG-17** `npm run init -- <slug> "<Name>"` turns a copy of the template into a new app, one
  time: it renames each literal of the template, starts the version at `0.1.0`, resets
  `CHANGELOG.md` and deletes `docs/superpowers/`. It changes no file when it fails.

## Storage keys

The doc keys are in [07-notes.md](07-notes.md). The device preferences are `pwa-nexus.lang`,
`pwa-nexus.hand`, `pwa-nexus.theme`, `pwa-nexus.modules` and `pwa-nexus.onboarded`.

## Change guide

| Change | Do |
|---|---|
| A new rule of the domain | An operation in its pure module with its tests, then a control in its view of `src/ui/` |
| A new view | A module of `src/ui/` with a `bind()` that `src/app.js` calls, its alias, its file in `SHELL`, its row in the module table and its name in `UI` of `designs/page.js` |
| A change of the shape of the doc | Its `normalize` function, a new `version` and its migration |
| A new text | A key in each catalog, with the same placeholders |
| A new module of `src/` | Its alias in the import map of `index.html`, and its file in `SHELL` of `sw.js` |
| A new file that the app loads | Its path in `SHELL` of `sw.js` |
| A stored doc that an old module cannot read | A new cache name in `sw.js` (SW-10) |
| A change of behaviour | The rule in this specification, in the same commit |

## Tests

`npm test` runs `node --test` (Node 20 or later).

| Test file | Covers |
|---|---|
| `tests/notes.test.js` | The note operations and the validation of the doc (demo) |
| `tests/roadmap.test.js` | The ROADMAP model, its operations and the fixtures of the real roadmaps (ROAD-1 … ROAD-9) |
| `tests/storage.test.js` | Load, save, the corrupt copy, export, import and the device preferences |
| `tests/install.test.js` | The install offer states (INS-1) |
| `tests/swipe.test.js` | The settle rule of a row slide |
| `tests/sw.test.js` | The manifest text that the worker puts in place (SW-13) |
| `tests/sections.test.js` | The slide between sections |
| `tests/modules.test.js` | The visible sections and the switch of a module |
| `tests/particles.test.js` | The particles of a picture and their place in time |
| `tests/onboarding.test.js` | The show rule and the page steps of the walkthrough |
| `tests/reorder.test.js` | The geometry of a row move |
| `tests/version.test.js` | Version rules and the update offer rule |
| `tests/i18n.test.js` | The language choice, the translator, the parity of the catalogs |
| `tests/markup.test.js` | `index.html` holds no text of its own; the sheet and the walkthrough markup |
| `tests/aliases.test.js` | The import map against `package.json` |
| `tests/layers.test.js` | The layer rules and `SHELL` (ENG-16) |
| `tests/design.test.js` | The rules of the design system over `styles.css`, `index.html`, `icons.svg` and `src/ui/` (DS-1 … DS-8) |
| `tests/catalog.test.js` | The parser of the design system catalogue, `designs/catalog.js` |
| `tests/png.test.js` | The PNG encoder and decoder of `scripts/png.mjs`, which `npm run icons` uses |
| `tests/release.test.js` | The release of `scripts/release.mjs`: the bump commit, the tag and the refusals (VER-10 to VER-12) |
| `tests/changelog.test.js` | The release of `CHANGELOG.md` by `scripts/changelog.mjs` (VER-17) |
| `tests/init.test.js` | The arguments of `scripts/init.mjs`, and a run of it in a copy: the new names, no trace of the template, its refusal of a second run (ENG-17) |
| `tests/spec.test.js` | The facts of this specification that the code can prove (ENG-12) |

A unit test uses `node:test` with `node:assert/strict`, one behaviour for each test, and checks
that the input state does not change.

## Checks with no test

- **ENG-9** `src/app.js`, the views of `src/ui/`, `styles.css` and `sw.js` have no unit test. A
  change to one of them is checked in a browser at 360×800, 768×1024 and 1280×800, with
  `npm run serve`. The offline check runs with the server stopped.
- **ENG-10** `.githooks/pre-push` and `.githooks/pre-commit` have no test. They are checked in a
  scratch clone, the first one with a bare remote.
- **ENG-11** A task is done when `npm test` passes and, for a change of the screen or of `sw.js`,
  the browser check ran.

## Upkeep of this specification

- **ENG-12** `tests/spec.test.js` compares the specification with the code: each rule identifier is
  defined one time and each named rule exists; each link has its file and the index lists each
  document; the storage keys and the cache names; the languages; each `error.*` and `toast.*` key
  that a document names; the module table against `src/` and against the imports of each module;
  the test table against `tests/`.
- **ENG-13** `.githooks/pre-commit`, enabled with `npm run hooks`, stops a commit that stages a
  change of the app with no staged change of `docs/spec/`. The app is `src/`, `sw.js`,
  `index.html` and `manifest.webmanifest`. Of the catalogs of `src/locales/`, only `es.js` counts.
- **ENG-14** A commit that changes no rule, such as a refactor, passes with
  `git commit --no-verify`, and its body says that no rule changed.
- **ENG-15** A change of behaviour changes its rule in the same commit as the code. This is part
  of the definition of done.
